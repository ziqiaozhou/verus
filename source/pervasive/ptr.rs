/// `PPtr<V>` (which stands for "permissioned pointer")
/// is a wrapper around a raw pointer to `V` on the heap.
///
/// Technically, it is a wrapper around `*mut core::mem::MaybeUninit<V>`, that is, the object
/// it points to may be uninitialized.
///
/// In order to access (read or write) the value behind the pointer, the user needs
/// a special _ghost permission token_, [`Permission<V>`](Permission). This object is `tracked`,
/// which means that it is "only a proof construct" that does not appear in code,
/// but its uses _are_ checked by the borrow-checker. This ensures memory safety,
/// data-race-freedom, prohibits use-after-free, etc.
///
/// ### Permission objects.
///
/// The [`Permission`] object represents both the ability to access the data behind the
/// pointer _and_ the ability to free it (return it to the memory allocator).
///
/// In particular:
///  * When the user owns a `Permission<V>` object associated to a given pointer,
///    they can either read or write its contents, or deallocate ("free") it.
///  * When the user has a shared borrow, `&Permission<V>`, they can read
///    the contents (i.e., obtained a shared borrow `&V`).
///
/// The `perm: Permission<V>` object tracks two pieces of data:
///  * `perm.pptr` is the pointer that the permission is associated to,
///     given by [`ptr.id()`](PPtr::id).
///  * `perm.value` tracks the data that is behind the pointer. Thereby:
///      * When the user uses the permission to _read_ a value, they always
///        read the value as given by the `perm.value`.
///      * When the user uses the permission to _write_ a value, the `perm.value`
///        data is updated.
///
/// For those familiar with separation logic, the `Permission` object plays a role
/// similar to that of the "points-to" operator, _ptr_ â†¦ _value_.
///
/// ### Differences from `PCell`.
///
/// `PPtr` is similar to [`cell::PCell`], but has a few key differences:
///  * In `PCell<T>`, the type `T` is placed internally to the `PCell`, whereas with `PPtr`,
///    the type `T` is placed at some location on the heap.
///  * Since `PPtr` is just a pointer (represented by an integer), it can be `Copy`.
///  * The `ptr::Permission` token represents not just the permission to read/write
///    the contents, but also to deallocate.
///
/// ### Example (TODO)

// TODO implement: borrow_mut; figure out Drop, see if we can avoid leaking?
